    (synopsis "Datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen")
    (description
     "The Datasaurus Dozen is a set of datasets with the same summary
statistics.  They retain the same summary statistics despite having radically
different distributions.  The datasets represent a larger and quirkier object
lesson that is typically taught via Anscombe's Quartet (available in the
'datasets' package).  Anscombe's Quartet contains four very different
distributions with the same summary statistics and as such highlights the value
of visualisation in understanding data, over and above summary statistics.  As
well as being an engaging variant on the Quartet, the data is generated in a
novel way.  The simulated annealing process used to derive datasets from the
original Datasaurus is detailed in \"Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating
Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated
Annealing\" @url{doi:10.1145/3025453.3025912}.")
